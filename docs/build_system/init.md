# Initialize a (new) project

You can initialize a new devm project with this command. It will create all the files needed by devm and more if project_type is set.
For example:

```sh
devm init clion
```

will create a compile_commands.json as well as the .devm.ts file if they do not exist yet.

Supported project types are:

- clion
- â€¦(planned)
